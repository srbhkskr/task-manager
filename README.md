# task-manager

A simple To-Do List application built with **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL** on the backend, and a dynamic **Frontend** with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to create tasks, view their tasks, and manage their statuses (To Do, Doing, Done) in a visually color-coded interface.
